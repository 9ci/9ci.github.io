      <p>In today’s world, the emergence of AI and cloud computing presents a remarkable opportunity.  Deep learning AI has made OCR engines much more affordable and flexible.  No more templates and zones.  And the accessibility of cloud computing minimizes IT involvement.  Consider this scenario:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place your lockbox file with check images, exactly as received from the bank, in a directory on your existing AR system</li>
            <li>In the cloud, that lockbox file is parsed, check images are passed through our OCR engine and remittance detail is extracted</li>
            <li>Payments and their invoice applications are formatted into a file that your own ERP can import directly into its AR system</li>
            <li>Our payment file is downloaded to your system and your cash appliers now have all the checks from the lockbox already applied with the customer remittance advice supplied.  They can immediately get to work and post those checks in your existing AR system.</li>
        </ol>
