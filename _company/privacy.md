9ci Inc Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a payment utilizing 9ci.com, greenbill.io or greenbill.com (the “Site”).

PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT

When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain Device Information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device.

We collect Device Information using the following technologies:

- “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
- “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
- “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site.

When you utilize the Site, we collect certain information from you, that can include your name, billing address, shipping address, payment information (including credit card numbers or bank account information), email address, and phone number.  We refer to this information as “User Information.”

When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and User Information.

HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

We utilize User Information that we collect generally to facilitate any payments made through the Site (including processing your payment information, shipping information, and providing you with invoices and/or order confirmations).  Additionally, we use this Information to
communicate with you and screen for potential risk or fraud.

We use the Device Information that we collect to also help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the performance and ease-of-use of the Site).

SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

We may use third-parties to implement and operate the Site, but beyond this, we do not share your Personal Information with any third parties.

However, we may share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.

YOUR RIGHTS

If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us through the contact information below.
Additionally, if you are a European resident we note that we are processing your information in order to fulfill contracts we might have with you (for example if you make an order through the Site), or otherwise to pursue our legitimate business interests listed above.  Additionally, please note that your information will be transferred outside of Europe, including to Canada and the United States.


DATA RETENTION

When you make a payment through the Site, we will maintain your Personal Information for our records unless and until you ask us to delete this information.

HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION

We implement security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. Your account is protected by your account
password and we urge you to take steps to keep your Personal Information safe by not disclosing your password and by logging out
of your account after each use. We further protect your information from potential security breaches by implementing certain
technological security measures including encryption, firewalls and secure socket layer technology.

Additionally, the Site does not store credit card information.  If you choose that your credit card information be retained for the ease of making or scheduling future payments, it will be retained by the credit card processor and a token representing your information will be returned to and stored by the Site.  This token cannot be used by anyone other than the Site to make a payment using your credot card information.  

However, these measures do not guarantee that your information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software. By using our Service, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.

CHANGES

We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.
