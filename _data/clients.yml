    Before 9ci, we spent more time gathering information, and now we spend more time analyzing it.
    I know you hear that over and over again with all the ERP marketing, but it’s absolutely true in our
    case. Today I can take a look at my deductions and reason codes, and instead of just sticking my
    finger in the hole where we’re bleeding, I can ask ‘Why do we have this many deductions?’ and
    go after the root cause of the problem.

    I’m not aware of anyone else that has solved an integration problem like this in this manner.
    During the implementation, 9ci exhibited a thorough understanding of both the systems and our
    business problem. The bottom line is that any tool that facilitates faster,
    more accurate cash application enhances the collection process as a whole.
    **And that’s good for business**.

    the information and results that our competitive industry demands.
